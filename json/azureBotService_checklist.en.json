Azure Bot Service automatically performs autofailover and auto recovery in a multi-region geographical architecture. For the EU bot regional service, Azure Bot Service provides two full regions inside Europe with active/active replication to ensure redundancy. For the global bot service, all available regions/geographies can be served as the global footprint.",
