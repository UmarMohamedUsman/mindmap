      "description": "Azure Data Explorer provides an optional follower capability for a leader cluster to be followed by other follower clusters for read-only access to the leader's data and metadata. Changes in the leader, such as create, append, and drop are automatically synchronized to the follower. While the leaders could span Azure regions, the follower clusters should be hosted in the same region(s) as the leader. If the leader cluster is down or databases or tables are accidentally dropped, the follower clusters will lose access until access is recovered in the leader.",
